# EFDM - European Forestry Dynamics Model

Show simple usage of the EFDM-nea by using a prior transition matrix.

1. Create a data set showing forest stock at two different time steps for different yield classes and management activities.
2. Transfer this information that it is usable for EFDM
3. Run Efdm
4. Compare Model estimates with observations

I'm able to reproduce the change form timestep0 to timestep1 with EFDM.
