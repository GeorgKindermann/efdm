# EFDM - European Forestry Dynamics Model

Show simple usage of the EFDM-nea:

Here I calcualte the transition propablility by my own.

1. Create a data set
2. Transfer this information that it is usable for EFDM
3. Run Efdm
4. Compare Model estimates with observations

I'm able to reproduce the change form timestep0 to timestep1 with EFDM.
